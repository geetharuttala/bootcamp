**Real-Time File Processing System – Final Wrap-Up**

---

## 1. Design Decisions

* **Modular Processors**: I designed the system with pluggable processors, each specified in a YAML file. This allows easy customization and scalability for new processors.
* **DAG Routing**: A Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) approach was used to dynamically route files through different processing steps. This setup offers flexibility for future changes or additions to the pipeline.
* **FastAPI Dashboard**: FastAPI was chosen for the dashboard because it is lightweight, async-friendly, and easy to set up. It efficiently handles real-time monitoring without much overhead.
* **Shared Metrics**: I implemented real-time tracing and metrics, stored in thread-safe structures for easy access across different components. This gives insights into processing performance and helps with debugging.
* **Concurrency**: Processing happens in a loop while the dashboard runs in a separate thread, ensuring that both can operate simultaneously without blocking each other.

## 2. Tradeoffs

* **In-memory Logging**: I chose to store logs and metrics in memory rather than a database, making the system faster but limiting long-term storage. This could be a problem for large-scale, long-running deployments.
* **Lack of Authentication**: The web dashboard is open without authentication. While this is acceptable for development, it would need proper access control for production.
* **Idempotent Processing Assumption**: The system assumes that file reprocessing after crashes is safe. This may not be true in all cases, and more complex file handling could be required.
* **Single-threaded File Processing**: File processing is currently single-threaded, which limits concurrency. This design simplifies the code but doesn’t scale well for high-volume environments.

## 3. Scalability

* **Scaling Up**: If the system were to handle 100x more files, I’d switch to multiprocessing or asynchronous processing to handle files concurrently.
* **Parallelization**: For true parallelism, I’d introduce a distributed queue system with locking mechanisms to ensure thread safety during file processing. This would allow the system to process files in parallel without conflicts.

---

## 4. Extensibility & Security

* **Production Readiness**: To make this system ready for real users, I'd add:

  * Validation for file uploads (size, type, etc.)
  * Authentication for the dashboard (e.g., token-based authentication)
  * Retry logic to handle intermittent failures
* **Security Measures**: I’d secure the system by:

  * Encrypting sensitive files during processing and storage
  * Implementing access control for the web dashboard and API
  * Adding monitoring and alerting tools to catch potential failures
