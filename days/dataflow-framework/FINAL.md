**Real-Time File Processing System – Final Wrap-Up**

## Summary of What I Built

* A streaming line processor evolved through 8 levels.
* The final version is a real-time, folder-watching, web-dashboard-enabled pipeline.
* It supports both single-file mode and continuous watch mode.
* It runs reliably, restarts cleanly, and exposes key stats via a FastAPI dashboard.

---

## 1. Design Decisions

* Built processors as pluggable components using import paths from YAML configs.
* Used a DAG to allow flexible routing between processors.
* Chose FastAPI for the dashboard because it's lightweight and async-friendly.
* Tracing and metrics stored in shared structures with thread-safe access.
* Processing system runs in a loop, while dashboard runs in a separate thread.

---

## 2. Tradeoffs

* Did not implement persistent logs or long-term metrics storage (in-memory only).
* No authentication on the web dashboard.
* Assumes idempotent file processing — reprocessing on crash is treated as safe.
* Currently single-threaded for file processing; no parallel processing of multiple files.

---

## 3. Scalability

* For large-scale input:

  * Switch to multiprocessing or async for concurrent file handling.
  * Use persistent queues and databases instead of in-memory dicts.
  * Offload metrics to Prometheus/Grafana.
* File-level parallelism would need locking or a distributed queue.

---

## 4. Extensibility & Security

* To make this production-ready:

  * Add file upload via the FastAPI UI or endpoint (with size/type validation).
  * Secure the API with basic auth or token headers.
  * Add retry/backoff for transient failures.
  * Introduce alerting (e.g., via Better Uptime) for system failures.

## Running the System

### Local Run

```bash
python main.py --input sample.txt          # Single-file mode
python main.py --watch                     # Continuous folder monitor mode
```

### Docker

```bash
make build-docker
make run
```

### FastAPI Dashboard

* Visit: `http://localhost:8000/stats` → live processor metrics
* Visit: `http://localhost:8000/trace` → recent line traces
* Visit: `http://localhost:8000/errors` → recent errors
* Visit: `http://localhost:8000/errors` → file state

## Reflection

* This project helped me think more like an operator, not just a developer.
* Adding observability really changed how I understood the runtime behavior.
* I learned how to manage file lifecycles, build safe restart mechanisms, and expose system internals in real time.
* It feels like a solid simulation of real-world data engineering workflows.
