## Day 1

### What I Learned
- Basics of Markdown syntax: headings, lists, links, code blocks, tables, and images.
- Difference between permanent docs (README) and throwaway practice (cheatsheets).
- PyCharm can show errors even in Markdown code blocks — harmless but good to know.
- How to structure a README with purpose, install, usage, and troubleshooting.
- Git best practices: committing only necessary files (daily log), skipping others.

### What Confused Me
- Whether to commit practice files
- PyCharm’s Markdown code linting

### Notes
- Use `-e .` to install a package in editable mode when developing locally.
- Ignore false errors in Markdown blocks
