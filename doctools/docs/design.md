## Components

- **Typer CLI**: Handles argument parsing and command registration.
- **Password Checker**: Contains logic for evaluating password strength based on:
  - Length â‰¥ 8
  - Use of digits
  - Upper/lowercase characters
  - Special characters
- **Rich Formatter**: Adds visual feedback to CLI output.

## Design Goals

- Simple to run locally via virtualenv and `-e .`
- Testable logic in isolation (`checker.py`)
- CLI output friendly for end-users (emoji + color)
