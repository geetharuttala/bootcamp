- Makefile with common commands
- Production-ready configuration
- Performance optimizations

### Phase 7: Documentation and Testing
- Create comprehensive documentation
- Implement unit and integration tests
- Add example usage scenarios
- Prepare deployment instructions

**Deliverables:**
- README and documentation files
- Test suite for key components
- Example usage scenarios
- Deployment instructions

- Test SQL injection prevention

### Performance Testing

#### Response Time
- Measure API response times under various loads
- Test dashboard loading performance
- Measure paper processing time

#### Batch Processing
- Test with varying batch sizes (10, 100, 1000 papers)
- Measure memory usage during batch processing
- Test concurrent processing capabilities

#### Resource Utilization
- Monitor CPU usage during processing
- Track memory consumption patterns
- Measure disk I/O during database operations

### Data Testing

#### Mock Data Testing
- Use synthetic paper data for predictable testing

- Test edge cases with crafted mock data

#### Real Data Testing
- Test with actual PMC papers
- Validate entity extraction with known entities
- Compare results with manual extraction
- Test with papers from different scientific domains

## Test Scenarios

### CLI Testing Scenarios
1. Process a single valid PMC ID
2. Process multiple valid PMC IDs
3. Process a mix of valid and invalid IDs
4. Export results in different formats
5. Test reset functionality

### API Testing Scenarios
1. Health check endpoint
2. Paper processing with valid/invalid API keys
3. File upload with various file types
4. Search with different query parameters
5. Export with different formats and filters

### Watched Directory Testing Scenarios
1. Process a single file with valid IDs
2. Process multiple files simultaneously
3. Test with malformed files
4. Test recovery from processing errors

### Dashboard Testing Scenarios
1. View papers and figures
2. Search functionality
3. File upload through the interface
4. Export data through the interface

## Continuous Testing

Throughout development, continuous testing was performed to ensure:
1. Code quality and adherence to standards
2. Functionality of new features
3. Regression prevention
4. Performance monitoring

This approach allowed for early detection of issues and maintained a high level of quality throughout the development process.
