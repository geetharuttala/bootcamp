# FigureX: Project Summary

## Project Overview

FigureX is a comprehensive system for extracting and analyzing figure captions, entities, and metadata from scientific papers. It provides tools for researchers, data scientists, and developers to access structured information from scientific literature, particularly focusing on figures and their associated captions.

## Project Goals

1. **Automated Extraction**: Extract figure captions, titles, abstracts, and figure URLs from scientific papers using PMC IDs or PMIDs
2. **Entity Recognition**: Identify entities (genes, diseases, chemicals, etc.) in figure captions
3. **Structured Access**: Provide programmatic and user-friendly access to the extracted data
4. **Batch Processing**: Support processing of multiple papers in batch mode
5. **Flexible Integration**: Enable integration with other systems through API and watched directory features

## Key Features

- **Multi-modal Access**: CLI, REST API, and web dashboard interfaces
- **Entity Extraction**: Identification of biomedical entities in figure captions
- **Search Capabilities**: Search papers based on various criteria (titles, captions, entities)
